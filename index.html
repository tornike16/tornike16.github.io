    <h1>History of the camera</h1>
</head>
<body>
<P>The history of the camera begins even before the introduction of photography. Cameras evolved from the camera obscura
    through many generations of photographic technology – daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film – to the modern
    day with digital cameras and camera phones.</P>
<h2>Camera obscura</h2>
<img src="Camera_obscura2.jpg" height="400">
<p>The forerunner to the photographic camera was the camera obscura. Camera obscura (Latin for "dark room") is the
    natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a
    wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside down)
    on a surface opposite to the opening. The oldest known record of this principle is a description by Han Chinese
    philosopher Mozi (ca. 470 to ca. 391 BC). Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because
    light travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote
    very influential books about optics, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened
    room.</p>
<p>The use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project images used as a
    drawing aid has been traced back to circa 1550. Since the late 17th century portable camera obscura devices in tents
    and boxes were used as a drawing aid.</p>
<p>Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras
    apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside;
    these gradually evolved into more and more compact models. By Niépce's time portable box camerae obscurae suitable
    for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for
    photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application
    was possible.</p>
<h2>Pinhole camera</h2>
<p>Ibn al-Haytham, an Arab physicist also known as Alhazen, wrote very influential essays about the camera obscura,
    including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room.[2] The invention of the camera has been
    traced back to the work of Ibn al-Haytham,[3] who is credited with the invention of the pinhole camera.[4] While the
    effects of a single light passing through a pinhole had been described earlier,[3] Ibn al-Haytham gave the first
    correct analysis of the camera obscura,[5] including the first geometrical and quantitative descriptions of the
    phenomenon,[6] and was the first to use a screen in a dark room so that an image from one side of a hole in the
    surface could be projected onto a screen on the other side.[7] He also first understood the relationship between the
    focal point and the pinhole,[8] and performed early experiments with afterimage.
<p>Ibn al-Haytam's writings on optics became very influential in Europe through Latin translations, inspiring people
    such as Witelo, John Peckham, Roger Bacon, Leonardo Da Vinci, René Descartes and Johannes Kepler.[2] Camera obscuras
    were used as drawing aids since at least circa 1550. Since the late 17th century, portable camera obscura devices in
    tents and boxes were used as drawing aids.

<h2>Photographic camera</h2>
<p>Before the development of the photographic camera, it had been known for hundreds of years that some substances, such
    as silver salts, darkened when exposed to sunlight.[9]:4 In a series of experiments, published in 1727, the German
    scientist Johann Heinrich Schulze demonstrated that the darkening of the salts was due to light alone, and not
    influenced by heat or exposure to air.[10]:7The Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele showed in 1777 that silver
    chloride was especially susceptible to darkening from light exposure, and that once darkened, it becomes insoluble
    in an ammonia solution.[10] The first person to use this chemistry to create images was Thomas Wedgwood.[9] To
    create images, Wedgwood placed items, such as leaves and insect wings, on ceramic pots coated with silver nitrate,
    and exposed the set-up to light. These images weren't permanent, however, as Wedgwood didn't employ a fixing
    mechanism. He ultimately failed at his goal of using the process to create fixed images created by a camera
    obscura</p>

<p>The first permanent photograph of a camera image was made in 1825 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce using a sliding wooden
    box camera made by Charles and Vincent Chevalier in Paris.[10]:9–11 Niépce had been experimenting with ways to fix
    the images of a camera obscura since 1816. The photograph Niépce succeeded in creating shows the view from his
    window. It was made using an 8-hour exposure on pewter coated with bitumen.[10]:9 Niépce called his process
    "heliography".[9]:5 Niépce corresponded with the inventor Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, and the pair entered into a
    partnership to improve the heliographic process. Niépce had experimented further with other chemicals, to improve
    contrast in his heliographs. Daguerre contributed an improved camera obscura design, but the partnership ended when
    Niépce died in 1833.[10]:10 Daguerre succeeded in developing a high-contrast and extremely sharp image by exposing
    on a plate coated with silver iodide, and exposing this plate again to mercury vapor.[9]:6 By 1837, he was able to
    fix the images with a common salt solution. He called this process Daguerreotype, and tried unsuccessfully for a
    couple of years to commercialize it. Eventually, with help of the scientist and politician François Arago, the
    French government acquired Daguerre's process for public release. In exchange, pensions were provided to Daguerre as
    well as Niépce's son, Isidore.</p>
<p>In the 1830s, the English scientist William Henry Fox Talbot independently invented a process to fix camera images
    using silver salts.[11]:15 Although dismayed that Daguerre had beaten him to the announcement of photography, on
    January 31, 1839 he submitted a pamphlet to the Royal Institution entitled Some Account of the Art of Photogenic
    Drawing, which was the first published description of photography. Within two years, Talbot developed a two-step
    process for creating photographs on paper, which he called calotypes. The calotyping process was the first to
    utilize negative prints, which reverse all values in the photograph – black shows up as white and vice versa.[9]:21
    Negative prints allow, in principle, unlimited duplicates of the positive print to be made.[11]:16 Calotyping also
    introduced the ability for a printmaker to alter the resulting image through retouching.[11]:67Calotypes were never
    as popular or widespread as daguerreotypes,[9]:22 owing mainly to the fact that the latter produced sharper
    details.[12]:370 However, because daguerreotypes only produce a direct positive print, no duplicates can be made. It
    is the two-step negative/positive process that formed the basis for modern photography.</p>
<p>The first photographic camera developed for commercial manufacture was a daguerreotype camera, built by Alphonse
    Giroux in 1839. Giroux signed a contract with Daguerre and Isidore Niépce to produce the cameras in France,[9]:8–9
    with each device and accessories costing 400 francs.[13]:38 The camera was a double-box design, with a landscape
    lens fitted to the outer box, and a holder for a ground glass focusing screen and image plate on the inner box. By
    sliding the inner box, objects at various distances could be brought to as sharp a focus as desired. After a
    satisfactory image had been focused on the screen, the screen was replaced with a sensitized plate. A knurled wheel
    controlled a copper flap in front of the lens, which functioned as a shutter. The early daguerreotype cameras
    required long exposure times, which in 1839 could be from 5 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>After the introduction of the Giroux daguerreotype camera, other manufacturers quickly produced improved variations.
    Charles Chevalier, who had earlier provided Niépce with lenses, created in 1841 a double-box camera using a
    half-sized plate for imaging. Chevalier's camera had a hinged bed, allowing for half of the bed to fold onto the
    back of the nested box. In addition to having increased portability, the camera had a faster lens, bringing exposure
    times down to 3 minutes, and a prism at the front of the lens, which allowed the image to be laterally
    correct.[14]:6 Another French design emerged in 1841, created by Marc Antoine Gaudin. The Nouvel Appareil Gaudin
    camera had a metal disc with three differently-sized holes mounted on the front of the lens. Rotating to a different
    hole effectively provided variable f-stops, allowing different amounts of light into the camera.[15]:28 Instead of
    using nested boxes to focus, the Gaudin camera used nested brass tubes.[14]:7 In Germany, Peter Friedrich
    Voigtländer designed an all-metal camera with a conical shape that produced circular pictures of about 3 inches in
    diameter. The distinguishing characteristic of the Voigtländer camera was its use of a lens designed by Joseph
    Petzval.[11]:34 The f/3.5 Petzval lens was nearly 30 times faster than any other lens of the period, and was the
    first to be made specifically for portraiture. Its design was the most widely used for portraits until Carl Zeiss
    introduced the anastigmat lens in 1889.</p>
